Test set for evaluating staff removal performance
=================================================

This is a collection of music images suitable for the evaluation
of staff removal quality with the aid of the Gamera MusicStaves
Toolkit that is available from music-staves.sourceforge.net.

The actual music images are in the directories "historic", "modern"
and "tablature" where each directory only contains images of the
specific type (historic, modern or tablature). For some images
the source files of the music typesetting program can be found
in the directory "src". The subdirectory "statisticSQL" contains
SQL scripts for generating statistics about the test set (like how
many staff systems of a particular music typesetting program the
test set contains).

For each image a full and a staffless version is provided; the latter
for ground truthing purposes. The images are both in Postscript
and PNG format, with the latter being generated from the Postscript
files with 300 dpi. To create bitmap images at different resolutions,
do NOT use the PNG files, but create them from the Postscript files
with the script "ps2png.sh" from the MusicStaves toolkit (in the 
directory "addons"). Alternatively you can use ghostscript directly
of course.

All images can be freely used, copied and distributed for the purpose
of staff removal or OMR evaluation. See the file License for details.
