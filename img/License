Usage terms and copyright notice for the test set
=================================================

All music images are copyrighted by their creators. The creator
of each image is listed in the file "Readme" in the same directory
containing the image.

All creators have given their permission to include their images
into our public test set, either directly by contributing their
images or indirectly by posting the images on the web under a free
license. Consequently all images can be freely used, copied and
distributed for staff removal or OMR evaluation purposes.

Beyond that, the following additional terms apply:

 - All images created by me can be freely used, copied and
   distributed for any purpose.

 - Files taken form the Mutopia project are subject to the Mutopia
   licensing terms which say:
   "All music on Mutopia may be downloaded, printed, copied, 
    distributed, modified, performed and recorded, without payment."

 - Files taken from the Choral Public Domain Library (CPDL) are
   subject to the CDPL license, which says:
   "[The] Edition may be freely distributed, duplicated, performed
    or recorded."
   Note that the CDPL also allows contributors to put their music images
   under a more restrictive license ("personal" license), but we have only
   used images posted under the CDPL license.

 - The file historic/derore01.ps is published by Laura Conrad under
   the GNU General Public license, which means that free use, redistribution
   and modification is allowed, provided the source code is also made
   available (we do so with the file src/derore01.ly).

 - The file modern/buxtehude.ps by Johann Tufvesson is subject to the
   following liecensing conditions (from the FAQ on 
   http://www.lysator.liu.se/~tuben/scores/):
   "Is it really free? Yes. As long as you don't sell them for profit I
    let you (and encourages you to) print them out and make copies for
    your friends (or enemies...). Please feel free to charge as much as
    you can while playing them."

 - The file historic/ockeghem.ps is published by M.A.B. Soloists under
   the following terms:
   "The scores in this library are all made and edited by members of M.A.B. 
    and the copyrights belong to M.A.B. You can use or distribute without 
    permission if you don't change contents nor not on commercial. If you 
    want to change the contents, be sure to leave the copyright discription 
    on top pages and add discriptions of yourself like `Arrenged by xxx' at 
    the title. If you want to use these scores on commercial, e-mail to 
    info@mab.jpn.org."
